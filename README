This is the complete source code of my Steam Completionist website.

This project is an attempt at learning more about the steam API, HTML 5 and CSS 3. The website itself is to motivate people to beat their backlog of steam games by providing a slick interface to mark games as "actively playing", launch games and view your achievement progress. Functionality to mark a game as beat / blacklist a game is forthcoming.

**Requirements**:

* Steam API Key ( Obtainable at [steamcommunity.com](http://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey) )
* PHP 5.3+
* MySQLIi extension

**Makes use of**:

 * LightOpenID class Copyright (c) 2010, Mewp under the MIT license
 * CSS reset stylesheet [http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/)
 * jQuery Javascript Framework [http://jquery.com/](http://jquery.com/)
 * jQueryUI Javascript Framework [http://jqueryui.com/](http://jqueryui.com/)
